# UFO-Sightings

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to help Dana build an interactive website using JavaScript and HTML. She wants to display a table to organize UFO sightings data. This table will have the ability to filter data based on the users' input. 

 

## ResultsÂ 
With the resulting webpage, users who are interested in UFO sightings will be able to find information on the topic for very specific criteria, such as the date and place the sighting occurred, and the shape of the UFO. There's a big amount of data that is now easy to access with the filter options. All users need to do is write on each of the filter fields following the suggested format, and they'll get the information they look for right away.

## Summary

One drawback of this new design is that it doesn't have a filter button and it might make the experience not so user-friendly. Recommendations for further development are to add a clear filter button that the user can click after they have written their inputs. Also, it could be a good idea to include links to refer to other websites for more detailed information about the specific UFO event, because the information in our current database is a bit limited. 
Adding as well, a blog section could be an interesting way to keep visitors engaged.
